To start the client and server side of the application:

1.  Place config.json in the /server directory (didn't include in GitHub repo for security reasons)
2.  Open a command terminal
3.  Run npm install on both /client and /server directory
4.  Navigate into /server directory and run npm start
5.  Open web browser and go to localhost:8080 (shouldn't see 404)
6.  Open a new tab in command terminal
7.  Navigate into /client directory and run npm start (wait for a while and should see HW2 UI w/o data)
